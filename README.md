# Project Euler Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to many [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. I like Project Euler because I enjoy the blend between mathematics and programming.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
``git clone https://github.com/LaXHeXLuX/ProjectEuler.git``
2. Navigate to the specific problem you're interested in (under [src/euler](src/euler)).
3. Review the solution and code.
4. Run at your own risk ;)
